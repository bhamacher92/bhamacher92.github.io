**ISO/IEC 25010** defines functional suitability as one of the nine key quality attributes for software. It further breaks down functional suitability into three sub-traits:

### Functional Completeness
The degree to which the set of functions covers all the specified tasks and intended user objectives.

Completeness is arguably one of the most ambiguous traits to define and measure. In agile project management methods, requirements often evolve throughout the project lifecycle, making it difficult to pin down what "complete" truly means. In such contexts, user satisfaction can serve as a proxy for completeness, though this measure is influenced by other quality attributes as well. Conversely, for projects with stringent regulatory requirements, completeness takes on a more concrete and stable definition, as compliance with regulations usually overrides flexibility in user-centric design.

### Functional Correctness
The degree to which a product or system provides accurate results when used by intended users.

Unlike completeness, correctness is typically more straightforward to assess. It can be measured against clearly defined acceptance criteria for new features. When the system produces results that align with the expectations of domain experts or stakeholders, it can be considered functionally correct.

### Functional Appropriateness
The degree to which the functions facilitate the accomplishment of specified tasks and objectives.

While correctness ensures that a system works as specified, appropriateness evaluates whether the system effectively addresses user needs. It’s possible for a system to meet all defined requirements (functional correctness) but still fail to deliver value to users if those requirements don't align with their real-world goals. Agile methodologies address this challenge by encouraging iterative refinement of correctness and completeness based on ongoing user feedback.

### How to Improve Functional Suitability
Agile development methodologies, such as [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) and [Scrum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum), have become industry standards due to their focus on fast feedback loops. These iterative processes help maintain alignment between functional appropriateness, completeness, and correctness by regularly revisiting and adapting user stories to reflect evolving user needs.

Bringing Product Owners and Developers into closer collaboration is crucial for ensuring functional suitability. Practices like [Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test-driven_development) and [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) enable teams to define and validate functionality from the user's perspective. Tools such as [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) and [Squish](https://www.qt.io/product/quality-assurance/squish) implement these concepts effectively through the Given-When-Then approach, fostering shared understanding and efficient communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Conclusion
Functional suitability is a cornerstone of software quality, encompassing the complementary attributes of completeness, correctness, and appropriateness. In my opinion achieving high functional suitability means balancing these attributes within the dynamic context of user needs, project goals, and regulatory constraints. Agile methodologies and collaborative practices like ATDD and BDD provide the mechanisms to adapt functionality iteratively, ensuring the software continues to deliver value over time.  functional suitability is less about adhering to static definitions and more about evolving the software to meet the real-world demands of its users.
