*This article is part of the Software Quality series. If you haven’t read the introductory article, you can check it out [here]({% post_url swq_series/2025-01-01-001-what-defines-software-quality %}).*

ISO/IEC 25010 defines compatibility as one of the nine key quality attributes for software. It further breaks down compatibility into two sub-traits.\\
Compared to the last article about maintainability, the subcategories here are not as easily understood. Therefore, I will go into more detail and not strictly adhere to the ISO/IEC 25010 definitions.

### Co-Existence

The degree to which a product can perform its required functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and resources with other products, without detrimental impact on any other product.

A good example of co-existence is when two applications run on the same system and depend on the same library. If both systems use the same version of the library, everything works fine. However, if they require different versions, conflicts can occur.

Another example could be a real-time environment where multiple processes run on the same machine. All processes must execute within their assigned time limits. Adding a new process might alter time behavior, potentially causing the system to breach these time constraints.

These examples are oversimplified but aim to illustrate the wide variety of challenges associated with co-existing software.

### Interoperability

The degree to which a system, product, or component can exchange information with other products and mutually use the information that has been exchanged.

This requirement seems straightforward, but why is it a problem? It depends on the context. In my career, much of the software I developed was highly specialized, and interoperability was not a significant issue. However, reflecting on it, even a small investment in interoperability considerations could have resulted in more user-friendly and flexible outcomes.

Let’s explain interoperability with a simple example: music. Imagine creating a music player with a proprietary file format. The software would be of limited utility because, without broader support for this format, users would be unable to play most music files. It’s as simple as that.

## How to Improve Compatibility

The requirements for compatibility vary significantly depending on the specific system. However, there are some common problems that can be easily tackled. 

### Shared Dependencies

Sharing Dependencies as described above can easily be tackled by using dependencies with concrete versions. Unlike in the early versions of windows it is no problem to use multiple version of the same library. Today windows uses [Assemblies](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/standard/assembly/) to solve this problem. Linux never had this issue since linux uses a very simple strategy to support concrete and canonical versions of one dependency.

### Assess Dependencies Early

Identify and manage dependencies between software components or external libraries early in the development process. Consider adopting versioning strategies such as semantic versioning to reduce conflicts when dependencies evolve.

### Standardize Communication Protocols

Use standard protocols and data formats (e.g., REST APIs, JSON, XML) to improve interoperability. This ensures that your software can communicate effectively with other systems, even those developed independently.

### Embrace Modular Design

Design your system with modularity in mind. Isolate components to ensure changes in one module have minimal impact on others, improving co-existence.

### Implement Backward Compatibility

For products with evolving features, ensure that new versions can work with older systems or data formats. Backward compatibility minimizes disruption for existing users.

### Test in Realistic Environments

Simulate production-like environments to identify and address potential co-existence issues. For example, testing your application with other common applications or on resource-constrained systems can reveal hidden conflicts.

### Promote Open Standards

Where possible, rely on open standards rather than proprietary formats. This enhances interoperability and ensures that your software remains adaptable to future technologies.

### Foster Collaboration

Engage with the developer community, partners, or other stakeholders to align on interoperability needs. Collaborative approaches can help ensure broader compatibility and better support for shared ecosystems.
