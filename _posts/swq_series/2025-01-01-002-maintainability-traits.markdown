**ISO/IEC 25010** defines maintainability, one of the nine software quality traits, as 
the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified to improve it, correct it or adapt it to changes in environment, and in requirements. 
It further breaks down maintainability into five sub-traits:

### Modularity
The degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components.

### Reusability
The degree to which a product can be used as an asset in more than one system or in building other assets.

### Analyzability
The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact of an intended change on a product or system, diagnose deficiencies or causes of failures, or identify parts to be modified.

### Modifiability
The degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality.

### Testability
The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product, or component, and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been met.

## How to Improve Maintainability

Maintainability is not primarily about enhancing the product from a business perspective but about empowering developers to make changes efficiently and confidently. Clean code, as described by Robert C. Martin in his book *[Clean Code](https://www.mitp.de/IT-WEB/Programmierung/Clean-Code.html)*, is one of the foundational pillars of maintainability. However, even well-readable code can be challenging to navigate when systems introduce excessive complexity. Reducing complexity should, therefore, be a key goal. A good starting point is adhering to the SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

For a detailed explanation of the SOLID principles, refer to this [comprehensive guide](https://medium.com/@cibofdevs/understanding-solid-principles-in-java-with-real-life-examples-d6fe93b0acc2). Following these principles can enhance all maintainability traits. In practice, however, applying these principles or detecting violations can be challenging. This is where the development community has devised various tools and methods to assist.

## Software Patterns

Software patterns are a significant resource for improving maintainability. Some patterns, such as Dependency Injection, align directly with specific SOLID principles. Navigating the wide array of available patterns can be daunting, but a good starting point includes the patterns described in:

- **[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/)** by the Gang of Four (GoF)
- **[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html)** by Martin Fowler

### Benefits of Using Patterns

1. **Quality Criteria Alignment**: Patterns often consider software quality criteria or balance competing concerns based on their use case.
2. **Recognizable Concepts**: Introducing well-known patterns into software increases the likelihood that other developers will recognize and understand them, provided they are properly implemented.

While some developers consider using patterns outdated, this perspective overlooks their ongoing relevance in frameworks such as [Spring](https://spring.io) and [Qt](https://www.qt.io). For example, Qt’s signal-and-slot mechanism is an advanced implementation of the observer pattern, as are many modern frameworks’ binding mechanisms. Java’s [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework could be considered the definition of Dependency Injection. In this environment usually realized using Java reflections.

### Understanding Patterns and Frameworks

Understanding the relationship between frameworks and patterns equips developers to:

- Analyze and address the problem at hand
- Select appropriate off-the-shelf solutions, such as libraries, with greater speed and accuracy

By leveraging patterns and frameworks, developers can craft solutions that enhance maintainability while reducing complexity and promoting code clarity.

## Conclusion

Maintainability is a cornerstone of high-quality software development, ensuring that systems can evolve and adapt efficiently over time. By adhering to principles like SOLID, leveraging software patterns, and understanding the relationship between frameworks and these patterns, developers can build systems that are not only robust but also easy to modify and extend. These practices ultimately save time, reduce errors, and empower teams to deliver software that meets both current and future needs.
