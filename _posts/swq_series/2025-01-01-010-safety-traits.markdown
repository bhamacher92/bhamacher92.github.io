*This article is part of the Software Quality series. If you havenâ€™t read the introductory article,

**ISO/IEC 25010** identifies safety as one of the nine essential quality attributes for software. This attribute is further divided into five sub-traits:  

### Operational constraint

Degree to which a product or system constrains its operation to within safe parameters or states when encountering operational hazard.

A system might be capable to operate within parameters these are not safe under all conditions. The system should 
prevent operators and itself from exposing  people, property or the environment to unacceptable risk and limit itself
accordingly.

### Risk identification

Degree to which a product can identify a course of events or operations that can expose life, property or environment to unacceptable risk.

A system might foresee risk but not intervene or act. A fitting example is a fitness tracker. The tracker observers 
the heart rate and can identify spikes logging these data for later analysis.


### Fail safe

Degree to which a product can automatically place itself in a safe operating mode, or to revert to a safe condition in the event of a failure.

The system shall provide features to identify from itself emerged hazards and return to a safe state on it's own.
A simple example is an autonomous car that slowly stops or returns control to the operator if sensors are not working properly.

### Hazard warning

Degree to which a product or system provides warnings of unacceptable risks to operations or internal controls so that they can react in sufficient time to sustain safe operations.

ISO 25010 provides a good example:
A pedestrian traffic light gives a warning sign, such as showing the remaining seconds, before reverting from green to yellow or red.

### Safe integration

Degree to which a product can maintain safety during and after integration with one or more components.

A sub-system can not looked upon without it's rest of the system. A for itself save subsystem might be save,
but combined with other systems safety can not be guaranteed anymore. For simplicity let's assume we consider a system that works safe 90% of the time save. We create two subsystem. Both match exactly 90%. Integrating them should be safe, shouldn't it. We implement a pipes and filters pattern. Using information provided by one sub-system in the next. A worst case contemplation would only end up with a system that only operates safe 81% of the time. The result is the product of both probabilities. The worst case contemplation assumes that the systems are never unsafe at the same time.

## How to Improve Safety
Safety is a complex and wide field. What's a hazard very much depends on the system and its environment.
Though **ISO/IEC 25010** divagates from this definition this overview will define a safety to be acceptable level of risk. WHile risk is the product of probability and severity. 

[IEC 61508](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4493673) provides standards for "functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety related systems". Especially interesting are part1 for classification and part7 as it describes measures related to software. IEC 61508 focuses on systems that can physically endanger people and therefore realtime systems. Real time requirements are not mandatory given. For instance a chatbot can give dangerous advice. This would fall within safety defined by ISO/IEC 25010 but is usually not time critical.

*Note: IEC 61508 is one of many norms is this area. For Instance automotive and health have specialized norms.
Though deviating in some aspects the concepts and methods are the same.*

Please keep in mind that equally to security safety is a field many people spend their whole carrier and a proper design requires specialized professionals in this area. Any uneducated attempt to figure these things out alone 
will end in inevitable failure.
However, for better understanding below are some helpful information how to indentify need for measures and what potential measures are provided by IEC 61508-7.

### Identifying safety Requirements
- **Finding Hazards**  
    Once the system is described it's possible to determine hazards. These hazards are expressed in severity levels and likelihood. Part of the hazard analysis is to determine critical system path. A critical path describes all system components that can trigger a hazardous failure. A common approach to bring these things together and determine where measures must be taken is a [Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis).

    The following example shows severity categories:

| <sub>**1** <br> Negligible</sub> | <sub>**2** <br> Minor<sub> | <sub>**3** <br> Moderate</sub> | <sub>**4** <br> Major </sub>| <sub> **5** <br> Catastrophic </sub> |
|:---------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|

- **Define System Safety Requirements**  
    Depending on the system safety requirements measures have to be taken to reduce risk to an acceptable level.
    The table below maps risk to [Safety Integration Levels (SIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_integrity_level). SIL defines a risk reduction factor. SIL dictates where and to what extend measures are 
    required.

### Common Measures
IEc 61508-3 and IEC 61508-7 defines measures and their fitness for SIL levels related to software.


1. **Pick the right technology**
Depending on the use case it's important to pick the right programming languages and compilers. Using interpreted languages for example 
would require proof that the interpreter itself satisfies all safety requirements. Therefore using native static typed languages like a 
enforced subset of C++ or Rust is required. Make sure to use certified compilers like [Ferrocene](https://ferrocene.dev/de/#:~:text=Ferrocene%20is%20ready%2Dto%2Duse%20Rust%20for%20embedded%20systems.&text=Rust%20is%20built%20for%20speed,developers%20take%20advantage%20of%20that.).

2. **Restrict Resources**
Software is rarely alone. In most scenarios software components run on the same node or even in the same application(Multithreading). Limiting resources for individual resources 
can be helpful to mitigate. For instance memory pools can prevent memory leaks from affection other processes on the same node.

3. **Use error detection methods**
It's impossible to create 100% reliable systems. Therefore it's important to implement error detection. Methods like [N-Version programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-version_programming) or [Watchdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer) are suitable methods.

4. **Keep the System stable**
Once on error is detected the system should transferred into stable condition. For example, if a memory pool is exhausted caused by a memory leak restarting the system can solve the problem.
Retry strategies like this are imaginable in many different contexts. If a retry is not suitable implementing step by step functional limitation like [Recovery Blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) to keep the system stable 
can be a good alternative.
